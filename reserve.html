            <h5>Tarangire</h5>
            <p>Tarangire National Park has some of the highest population density of elephants
                 as compared to anywhere in Tanzania. Located just a few hours drive from the 
                 town of Arusha, Tarangire is a popular stop for people travelling through the
                  northern safari circuit on their way to Ngorongoro and the Serengeti. 
                  The park extends into two game controlled areas and the wildlife is allowed
                   to move freely throughout.</p>
